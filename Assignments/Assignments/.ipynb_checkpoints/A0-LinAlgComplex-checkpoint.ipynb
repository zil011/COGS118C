    "# Some Jupyter Tricks\n",

Each cell can be run (executed) separately, but they populate the same \"name space\", i.e., not independent. If you initialize and do some operations on a variable in one cell, and change it in another, that will affect the initial cell. It's similar to cells in a MATLAB script. \n",

    "    - M to change the cell to Markdown (fancy text, non-executable). Markdown is how all these instructions are written, and also where you will provide short-form responses in all the assignments. There are a lot more ways of formatting than plaintext, for example, __bold__.\n",
    "- Shift-Enter to run a cell, which will execute the code, or set the Markdown text\n",
