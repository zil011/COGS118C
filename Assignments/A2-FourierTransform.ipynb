Using Euler's formula, we can separate the complex exponential into a real (cosine) and an imaginary (sine) component.

OR, you can picture it as the hand jumping a single step counterclockwise, to -1/N. Because everything we work with is in discrete time, these two scenarios are indistinguishable, and the boundary at which this phenomenon occurs is at `k=N/2`, which corresponds to `fs/2`. This is known as the **Nyquist frequency**, and it's where sinusoidal rotations start to appear as if they are rotating backwards. See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNftf5qLpiA) for a visual demonstration. This is also what gives rise to **aliasing**, which we will explore in detail in the last section.\n",
    "\n",
    "[BONUS: 2] Uncomment the code below. Write a modified version of your `freq_from_k` function inside `freq_from_k_nyq` such that it returns negative wave frequencies for frequencies greater than the Nyquist frequency. Call the function and store the result in `your_freqs_nyq`, and plot it in the same plot. It should overlap completely with the numpy result."

Computing and looking at the power spectrum is one of the most common ways of characterizing neural signals, especially for identifying strong rhythmic components in the data (neural oscillations). Almost every lab on campus that works with EEG, ECoG, or LFPs will at some point compute a power spectrum to look for rhythmic signals, including Profs. Lara Rangel, Doug Nitz, Brad Voytek, and many more. Neural oscillations is a huge field of neuroscience research, and there's plenty of work to be done here!"

    "We can then create a downsampled version of our signal by taking every 50th sample, which gives us an effective sampling rate of 1000/50 = 20Hz. By the Nyquist sampling theorem, we know that for a signal of frequency B, we have to sample at least 2B Hz. In other words, if the sampling rate is fs, the highest frequency signal we can resolve is fs/2, which is called the Nyquist frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, our downsampled signal is sampled at 20Hz, which means we can resolve a signal of at most 10Hz. Remember the weird clocks? Well, if a 14Hz signal sampled at 20Hz is like rotating around the circle clockwise 14 times per second, it will produce the same sequence of clock positions as if it's rotating around the circle counterclockwise 6 times per second, or -6Hz. The math is $14-20 = -6$\n",
