# COGS118C - Neural Signal Processing (UCSD)
Welcome to Neural Signal Processing.
This repo contains all the course material, including course documents, finished slides, and assignments starters.

---

+ Are you excited by the notion of controlling an exoskeleton with your brain signals? 
+ Are you curious about the scientific pursuit of dissecting the neural basis of our minds? 
+ Are you driven by creating consumer neurofeedback technologies that can improve our lives? 
+ Or are you simply fascinated with decoding the brain as an extremely complex electrochemical system?

Learning how to analyze brain signals, as well as understanding their biological origins, are the first steps to accomplishing all of the above. Welcome to Neural Signal Processing (in Python).

See ./Course Documents/Syllabus.pdf for details.
