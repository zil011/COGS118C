# Guide for Reading Papers & Submitting Reading Questions

Scientific articles are notoriously difficult to read, even for scientists. If you're having troubles on your first go - don't worry, everyone does.

That being said, there are concrete things you can do to overcome those challenges:

- On your first read-through, jot down any words you don't know. This might become a big list, but after you've read through once, you will notice that some of those words come up more often than others. They are probably important in the context of this paper, as well as the background of the field as a whole. Most of these you will be able to find definitions for on Google or Wikipedia, though there may be more words you don't know in those definitions.

- A scientific paper for an undergraduate student is like giving you an answer to a question you didn't know you had. Remember this. Therefore, the most important thing is to figure out what the question is. It's basically like playing jeopardy on the hardest level: given a random sentence, you have to reconstruct what question would have been asked.

- The saying goes: 80% of the work is done in 20% of the time. This is true here as well. Following the last point, being explicitly aware of the research question can then guide you towards understanding how it's answered/addressed in this paper. You should aim to reconstruct a rough skeleton or structure of the paper in your head. From this point on, the structure will roughly follow the headings of the paper: Introduction (what do we know and why did we do this), Method (how), Results (what we found), and Discussion (how we could be wrong and what to do following).

- As much as it is possible, do the above while ignoring any words or concepts you don't yet know. It's like doing algebraic manipulation with blackboxes, whose roles you can infer based on how the authors use them in the construction of the argument.

For your reading assignment, which is to submit one question about your reading, we are looking for high-level questions that demonstrate understanding. Questions of the form "what is an X" or "what does Y do" that can be answered by a quick ctrl-F find or Googling, or otherwise be answered in less than a minute, will not receive the full point. The point of the reading questions is to train your high-level thinking skills in parsing the structure and challenging the assumptions of the paper.

Think of the paper as having an hourglass shape: the broad background funnels into a specific question that gets carefully addressed with data, which the expands out again to be extrapolated for the general case. Questions that aim to clarify or challenge any step in this chain of inference, as well as extending the findings of the study are encouraged. Some examples:
- the authors assume X and design there experiment accordingly, what if they had assumed Y?
- given that the authors found Z, what are its implications on W?
- why did the authors use method A for analysis, when it's equally valid (or better) to use method B?

Your question can be as long as you need to motivate your reasoning.

The questions will be collected and motivate the paper discussion during the Monday labs.
