First, we will use the Hilbert transform to compute the time-resolved (complex) analytic signal for a narrowband oscillation in the LFP, and its instantaneous power and phase. Then, we'll look at coupling of phase and amplitude across frequencies. Finally, we will introduce spike trains, the (smoothed) firing rate vector, and a couple of spike-LFP analyses. By the end of this lab, you should have the theoretical understanding and practical know-how to start working in most human or animal electrophysiology labs!\n",

    "# [10 + 2 Bonus] Q3: Phase Amplitude Coupling (Canolty et al., 2006)\n",
    "There are often multiple oscillations present in a brain recording, at the same time. In Canolty et al., 2006, the authors explore phase-amplitude coupling between theta (4-8Hz) and gamma (100-150Hz) oscillations. We will have discussed this paper in class. To summarize, the finding is that the phase of the slow oscillation, i.e., whether it's at the peak or trough of its cycle, is systematically related to the power of the faster oscillation. There is a huge amount of literature stemming from this work, positing that the slow oscillation is acting like a periodically-opening gate that modulates the fast oscillation, which carries the information content, akin to how an amplitude-modulated (AM) radio works. We won't examine the theory too closely here, but I will guide you through the steps of reproducing this analysis in the rat LFP, which also happens to exhibit theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling, but at a different gamma frequency.\n",

Create a 251-point filter with a passband of 30-50Hz, and filter the lfp signal `lfp_short`. Then, compute the instantaneous power and phase of your filtered gamma oscillation. You can copy the same snippet of code above, but be careful to change the variables correspondingly (everywhere from `theta` to `gamma`).\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] 3.2: On the same plot, plot the first 2 seconds of theta phase and gamma power. Label! To make them appear roughly the same scale, you will have to multiply your gamma power by about 4, **only when plotting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] 3.3: In Fig.1C of the paper, the authors split theta phase into peak and trough. In the complex plane (diagram above), if you were to divide the circle into two semicircles, where would you draw the line such that one half contains (and is centered at) the phase corresponding to the peaks of the oscillations, and the other half contains the trough of the oscillation? Which half corresponds to the peak phases? Hint: look at your plot for Q2.\n",

In a new plot, use `peak_inds`, and `trough_inds` to plot the peak and trough phases separately (but in the same plot). They should segment your original phase plot into two different colors. Make sure that this matches your answer for Q3.3.\n",

After this step, this second plot should look identical to the first one, but with 4 different colors that separate the data according to theta peak and troughs.\n",

To try to reproduce the finding exactly, we will compute the **amplitude distrbution, instead of the power distribution.** I have set up most of the code for you for plotting the histogram. You need to complete the call to `plt.hist()` such that it computes the distribution of **gamma amplitude** for those indices corresponding the theta peaks and troughs. This is the same as what you did in Q3.5, **but instead of power, transform it to get the amplitude**. Label the traces and axes appropriately.\n",

    "[BONUS 1] 3.8: Binning theta phase by peak vs. trough is one crude way to do it. Another way to visualize this is to plot the gamma amplitude by their corresponding theta phase. Produce a plot where the x-axis is theta phase and y-axis is gamma amplitude. Just by examining the plot visually, discuss whether this results in similar or different conclusions as Q3.7, and why.\n",
    "\n",

Reproduce this analysis, compute and print the modulation index value for the LFP data above, as well as the preferred phase. The modulation index should be about 0.0149."

Following the same convention, `len_pre` is how many seconds of data to grab to the left of the index, and should be negative, and `len_post` is how much data to the right. **You can literally paste over your functions from A1, with one modification:** the first few spike times occur very early, so that there isn't enough data to the left to grab a full window.

    "# [6 + 2 Bonus] Q5: Spike-Field Coherence & Preferred Phase\n",
    "A more frequency-specific way of measuring the interaction between spike timing and LFP is to look at the phase distribution at spike times. Instead of collecting windows of the broadband LFP data, we can look at the theta oscillation and whether its phase is consistently related to spike timing. At the core of it, we are computing a histogram: at every spike time, we can look up the bandpassed signal's phase using the corresponding index in `spike_lfp_indices`, and we simply array-index all those phases and make a histogram to see if they are uniformly distributed as a function of phase. If spikes are equally likely to occur at all phases, that means the phase of that frequency has no relationship with spike timing. On the other hand, if the distribution is anything but uniform, then we can infer that spikes preferentially occur at certain phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] 5.1: Compute the theta analytic power and phase again, but use the full lfp signal `lfp`, instead of `lfp_short`. This means re-filtering your LFP for the theta oscillation using the same FIR filter `FIR_theta`. The data is a lot longer, so `signal.hilbert()` can take a second to run. Your `my_hilbert()` might actually be faster, for some very strange `scipy` reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] 5.2: Using array-indexing and `spike_lfp_inds` you computed from above, retrieve just the phases corresponding to when a spike has occurred. Store that in the variable `spike_theta_phases`.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] 5.3: I plot for you the distribution of theta phases at which a spike occurs. Label the x and y axes appropriately. Which phase are spikes most likely to occur at, and how does that relate to what you see in Q4.6?\n",
    "\n",
    "[2] 5.4: Repeat 5.1-3 for the gamma oscillation, for the full LFP data, using FIR_gamma. Plot the histogram (copy and paste the line I write for you and change the variable). Comment on whether and how gamma oscillation is related to spiking timing. If so, how does the modulation strength and preferred phase compare to that of the theta oscillation?\n",
    "\n",
    "[BONUS 2] 5.5: Produce a rose plot (polar histogram) for both the theta and gamma spike-phase distributions. You may wish to follow this [example](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/gallery/pie_and_polar_charts/polar_bar.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] 5.6: Spike Field Coherence (SFC) is technically defined as the power spectrum of the STA. Compute this and plot it in frequency domain, zoom into 0-50Hz. You could plot this using a linear or log-scaled y-axis."

    "For the last part, we will work with a binned spike vector. We currently have the spiking information stored in an array that corresponds to their spike times (in seconds) and the corresponding LFP index. This representation of the data is unlike the timeseries we've been working with (discrete signals sampled at **regular intervals**) and is harder to manipulate (but the upside is that spike times stored this way requires less memory). As such, we'll turn the spike times into a vector (spike counts) matching the length of the lfp signal, representing the same discrete time bins. The value at each index in the `spike_count` vector is the number of spikes that fell into that time bin. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the binned spike train has a bin width of 1ms, then the first bin represents the time between [0, 1) ms, and if there are spikes with timestamps of 0.32ms, 0.59ms, and 0.9ms, then that 0th bin would get a value of 3, for 3 spikes. Hence, it's the **spike count** per time bin. In the following exercise, we will create a spike count vector, sampled at the same rate as the LFP, and perform several analyses using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] 6.1: `np.digitize()` returns an array that bins the values of the data `x` into the bin vector `bins`. Meaning, the variable `bin_indices` matches every single spike time (`spike_time`) to a time bin in `t_lfp`. Write code below that will iterate through every index in `bin_indices` and increase the corresponding element in `spike_count` by 1. This will create your spike count vector, and `spike_count[68]` should return 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "[2] 6.2: The spike count vector is very noisy, and we are typically more interested in the firing rate, which is computed by smoothing (or taking the **moving average** of) the spike count vector with a window function, usually a Gaussian window that integrates (sums) to 1. Create a 200-ms long Gaussian window, with a standard deviation of 40-ms, using `signal.windows` (you will have to convert those lengths in time into number of samples using `lfp_fs`). Normalize the Gaussian window such that it sums to 1, and convolve it with your spike count vector. Make sure that `mode='same'`. This is your firing rate vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] 6.3: Plot your firing rate vector, as well as theta power (on the same plot), and label appropriately. Zoom into the first 60 seconds. Comment on any similarity/differences between the traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] 6.4: Now you have two time series, the firing rate vector and the theta power vector. Often times, the log10 power is used instead of log power, so compute the log10 transform of theta power and save that in `log_theta_power`. Plot log theta power (y-axis) as a function of firing rate (x-axis), since they have the same number of points. Describe what you see, whether they are related, and how this compares to your response for 6.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] 6.5: Using `np.corrcoef()`, compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between the log10 theta power and firing rate (read the documentation if you're unsure what the output is). Is this consistent with your response for 6.3&4, and what interpretations can you make about this observation?\n",
    "\n",
    "[BONUS 1] 6.6: An action potential has a refractory period, so the same neuron typically cannot fire more than once within 1ms. Given that, do you think the the spike times in this dataset came from one neuron? Support your answer."
